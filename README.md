# Churn Out Predictor using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Customer churn prediction helps businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave, allowing them to take proactive measures to improve customer retention.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training the model.
- **Model Building and Training:** Constructing and training an ANN model to predict churn.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using various metrics.
- **Prediction:** Using the trained model to predict churn on new data.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `experiments.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- `prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for making predictions on new data using the trained model.
- `data/`: Directory for storing the dataset.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).
